# Cat-O-File
### a CRUD app to help people with many cats or other pets keep tabs on their animals

Designed with the Crazy Cat Lady in mind. Cat-O-File is a system used to track your pets. When you reach double digits in the pet count it can be hard to keep track of your animal's likes, dislikes, special diet, even their names. 

My first (somewhat silly) open source project, Cat-O-File is a CRUD app created with [Yoman](http://yeoman.io/) and [MEAN.JS](http://meanjs.org/). I am using this project to explore full stack development.
